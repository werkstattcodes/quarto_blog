Yet another blog…

Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog… but there you go. This (work in progress?) blog is a collection of my ‘thoughts in R’ with varying degrees of seriousness. Posts are partly a playground to testdrive some new ideas/packages, partly more elaborated with some substantive angle. Not claiming any final truth. One step at a time. 

Note that I recently moved this blog and hence a few entries are somewhat ‘messy’ (broken links, images out of place). I’ll hope to be able to iron this out soon.
