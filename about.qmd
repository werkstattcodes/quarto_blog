Yet another blog…

Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog… but there you go. This (work in progress?) blog is a collection of my ‘thoughts in R’ with varying degrees of seriousness. Posts are partly a playground to testdrive some new ideas/packages, partly more elaborated with some substantive angle. Not claiming any final truth. One step at a time.

If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions, feel free to contact me via direct message on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/zoowalk.bsky.social){target="_blank"}. If you think my work, as showcased on this page, could be helpful to you, don't hesitate to contact me.
