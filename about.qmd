Yet another blog…

Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog… but there you go. This (work in progress?) blog is a collection of my ‘thoughts in R’ with varying degrees of seriousness. Posts are partly a playground to testdrive some new ideas/packages, partly more elaborated with some substantive angle. Not claiming any final truth. One step at a time.

If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions, feel free to contact me via direct message on [mastadon](https://mastodon.social/@zoowalk){target="_blank"} or [twitter](https://twitter.com/zoowalk){target="_blank"}. I am also doing more and more freelance work (data analytics, data viz etc...) these days. If you think my work, as showcased on this page, could be helpful to you, let's talk.
