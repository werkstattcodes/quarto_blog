The context is that I was recently interested in transcripts of sessions of Austria's parliament and noticed that those of more recent legislative periods are not included in an already compiled dataset.[^1] Hence, the interest and need to dig into transcripts provided on the parliament's website.\n\n[^1]: [@rauh2020]\n\nThis post will lay out the necessary steps in R to get transcripts of multiple sessions from multiple legislative periods, and subsequently retrieve statements by individual speakers. The result, a file comprising all statements for the 16th and 17th legislative period (as of 3 Nov'21), is **available for download [here](https://data.world/zoowalk/parlspeeches){target=\"_blank\"}**. If you use it, I would be grateful if you acknowledge this blog post. If you have any question or spot an error, feel free to contact me via [twitter DM](https://twitter.com/zoowalk){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Get the links of all sessions of multiple legislative periods\n\nThe parliament's website provides an overview of all sessions held during a specific legislative period [here](https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PLENAR/){target=\"_blank\"}. Below a screenshot of the site for the current legislative period:\n\n![](RSS_legis_periods.png)\n\nWe can use this overview page to extract the links leading to each session's details page which includes links to the transcripts. However, instead of scraping the links to the details page from the table, I used the data provided via the site's RSS-feed. The provided XML-format is IMHO considerably more convenient to work with than fiddling with the table itself.\n\nTo get the link leading to the XML file, click on the RSS symbol. In the above example the address is\n\n```{r, include=T, echo=F, code_folding=NULL}\nprint(\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PLENAR/filter.psp?view=RSS&jsMode=&xdocumentUri=&filterJq=&view=&MODUS=PLENAR&NRBRBV=NR&GP=XXVII&R_SISTEI=SI&listeId=1070&FBEZ=FP_00\")\n\n```\n\nSince we might be also interested in sessions from other legislative periods, let's have a look at the above link. As you can see, the query in the link contains the argument 'GP=XXVII', i.e. the XXVII legislative period. If we are interested in sessions of e.g. the XXVI legislative period as well, we will need to modify the link accordingly. This can be done relatively conveniently with the `glue` function:\n\n```{r, code_folding=F}\nlegis_period <- c(\"XXVI\",\"XXVII\")\nlinks_rss_sessions<- glue::glue(\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PLENAR/filter.psp?view=RSS&jsMode=&xdocumentUri=&filterJq=&view=&MODUS=PLENAR&NRBRBV=NR&GP={legis_period}&R_SISTEI=SI&listeId=1070&FBEZ=FP_007\")\nlinks_rss_sessions\n\n```\n\nThis vector, containing the links to both XML files which in turn contain the links leading to our session pages, has now to be fed into a function that actually extracts the links which we are interested in. The function below does this. Comments are inserted in the chunk.\n\n```{r, code_folding=FALSE}\nfn_get_session_links <- function(rss_session) {\n\n# rss_session <- \"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PLENAR/filter.psp?view=RSS&jsMode=&xdocumentUri=&filterJq=&view=&MODUS=PLENAR&NRBRBV=NR&GP=XXVI&R_SISTEI=SI&listeId=1070&FBEZ=FP_007\"\n\n#extract the legislative period from the RSS-feed address  \nlegis_period <- str_extract(rss_session, regex(\"(?<=GP\\\\=)[^\\\\&]*(?=\\\\&)\"))\n\n#read the xml file;\ndf_rss_session <- xml2::read_xml(rss_session)\nrss_data <- xml_child(df_rss_session, 1)\n\n#create df with session name, id, and link to session's details page\ndf_rss_session_name <- rss_data %>%\n  xml2::xml_find_all(\"//title\") %>%\n  html_text() %>%\n  #create a dataframe\n  enframe(.,\n          name = \"id\",\n          value = \"session_name\"\n  ) %>% \n  #keep only those results which contain the value \"Sitzung\" (session)\n  filter(str_detect(session_name, \"Sitzung|Nachtrag\")) %>% \n  #add a session id but ensure that id has same length\n  mutate(session_id=str_extract(session_name, regex(\"[:digit:]+\"))) %>% \n  #str_pad! adds leading zeros; takes length of string into account\n  mutate(session_id_pad=stringr::str_pad(session_id, width = 5, pad = 0)) %>%\n  #compose the link leading to the session's details page by inserting the legislative period and the session number (padded) into the link, andadd tab destination\n  mutate(link_records=glue::glue(\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/{legis_period}/NRSITZ/NRSITZ_{session_id_pad}/index.shtml#tab-Sten.Protokoll\")) %>% \n  mutate(session_name=str_trim(session_name))\nnrow(df_rss_session_name)\n\n\n#create df with date of session\ndf_rss_session_date <- rss_data %>%\n  xml2::xml_find_all(\"//pubDate\") %>%\n  html_text() %>%\n  enframe(.,\n          name = \"id\",\n          value = \"date_session\"\n  ) %>%\n  #important to adjust for time zone\n  mutate(date_session = lubridate::dmy_hms(date_session, tz=\"Europe/Vienna\"))\nnrow(df_rss_session_date)\n\n\n#combine both dataframes\ndf_sessions <- bind_cols(\n  df_rss_session_date,\n  df_rss_session_name,\n  ) %>%\n  select(-contains(\"id\")) %>% \n  mutate(legis_period=legis_period)\n\ndf_sessions\n}\n\n```\n\nNow let's apply this function to the vector.\n\n```{r, code_folding=F, eval=T, cache=F, cache.extra=Sys.Date()}\n\nlibrary(xml2)\ndf_sessions <- links_rss_sessions[[1]] %>% \n  map(., possibly(fn_get_session_links, \n                       otherwise=\"missing\"))  %>%\n                       list_rbind()\n\n```\n\nAs a result we obtain a dataframe with `r nrow(df_sessions)` rows (links to sessions' details pages) in total.\n\n```{r, echo=F, code_folding=NULL, eval=T}\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(reactable)\nlibrary(reactablefmtr)\n\ndf_sessions %>% \n  select(legis_period, session_name, link_records) %>% \n  group_by(legis_period) %>% \n  # slice_head(., n=2) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding = 0),\n            defaultColDef = colDef(minWidth = 50),\n            columns = list(\n              legis_period=colDef(width=100),\n              session_name=colDef(width=100)\n            ))\n  \n```\n\n```{r, echo=F, code_folding=NULL}\ntbl_records <- df_sessions %>% \n  group_by(legis_period) %>% \n  count(., name = \"session_n\") %>% \n  janitor::adorn_totals(where = \"row\")\n\nn_current_session <- tbl_records %>% \n  filter(legis_period==\"XXVII\") %>% \n  pull(session_n)\n```\n\nIf you have a look at the screenshot from above, you'll see that we got indeed all `r n_current_session` session of the current legislative period as of the time of writing.\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, eval=T}\ntbl_records %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding = 0))\n```\n\n# Extract links leading to transcripts\n\nAs you could already see in the function `fn_get_session_links` above, the `link_records` not only comprises the link to the session's details page, but was complemented by the expression `#tab-Sten.Protokoll` at the end. The reason for this addition is that the actual link leading to the session's transcript is located at a distinct tab on the session's details page. Below a screen shot for an example:\n\n![](Overview_individual_session.png)\n\nIn the next step we have to retrieve the link finally leading us to the transcript. If we hover over the link leading to the HTML version of the 'Stenographisches Protokoll' (stenographic transcript), we can see that the address e.g. for the transcript of the 74th session is\n\n```{r, eval=T, code_folding=NULL}\n\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXVII/NRSITZ/NRSITZ_00074/fnameorig_946652.htm\"\n```\n\nHowever, since we are not only interested in this particular case, but also in the links pertaining to other sessions we need to find a way to retrieve all the links in question by means of a general query. The code below does this.\n\nWe first extract all (!) links contained on the transcript tab with the `rvest` package, and then filter out the relevant link with the regular expression `\"\\\\/NRSITZ_\\\\d+\\\\/fnameorig_\\\\d+\\\\.html$\"`.\n\n```{r,  eval=T, code_folding=F}\nfn_get_link_to_records <- function(link_to_transcript_tab) {\n\n  res <- link_to_transcript_tab %>% \n    rvest::read_html() %>% \n    rvest::html_elements(\"a\") %>% \n    rvest::html_attr(\"href\") %>% \n    enframe(name = NULL,\n            value = \"link_to_text\") %>% \n    filter(str_detect(link_to_text, regex(\"\\\\/NRSITZ_\\\\d+\\\\/fnameorig_\\\\d+\\\\.html$\"))) %>% \n    mutate(link_to_text=glue::glue(\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/{link_to_text}\")) %>% \n    pull()\n  \n  #if no link is identified, return NA_character\n  ifelse(\n    length(res)==1,\n    res,\n    NA_character_\n  )\n  \n}\n```\n\nIn the next step let's apply this function to all links leading to submissions' details page/the tab for transcripts. Note that I used the `furrr` package enabling us to apply the function in parallel rather than sequentially and hence accelerate things a bit.\n\n```{r,  eval=F, code_folding=F, cache=T, cache.extra=Sys.Date()}\nlibrary(furrr)\nplan(multisession, workers=3)\n\ntbl_missing <- tibble(link_to_text=NA_character_)\n\ndf_link_text <- df_sessions %>% \n  mutate(link_to_text=future_map_chr(link_records, \n                              possibly(fn_get_link_to_records,\n                                       otherwise=NA_character_),\n                              .progress = T))\n```\n\n```{r, eval=T, include=F}\n# readr::write_csv2(df_link_text, file=here::here(\"_blog_data\", \"2021_5_nr_speeches\", \"df_link_text.csv\"))\n```\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T, include=F}\ndf_link_text <- readr::read_csv2(file=here::here(\"posts\", \"2021-04-20-extracting-speeches-held-at-austrias-parliament\", \"df_link_text.csv\")) %>%\nrename(date_session=date)\n```\n\nWhat we obtain is a dataframe with the links to all transcripts.\n\n```{r,  eval=T, code_folding=NULL}\ndf_link_text %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, session_name, link_to_text) %>% \n  # slice_head(., n=5) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding=0),\n            columns = list(\n              legis_period=colDef(width=150),\n              date_session=colDef(width=80,\n                          format=colFormat(date=T, \n                                           locale=\"de-De\")),\n              session_name=colDef(width=100),\n              link_to_text=colDef(width=600)\n            ))\n  \n```\n\nNote that there are some sessions where no link to a transcript could be retrieved. A look at these sessions' dates reveals that the missing links pertain to the most recent sessions. The finalized transcripts are only available after some delay. We remove these missing observations.\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=F, eval=T}\ndf_link_text %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, session_name, link_to_text) %>% \n  filter(is.na(link_to_text)) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(),\n            columns = list(\n              legis_period=colDef(width=150),\n              date_session=colDef(width=80,\n                          format=colFormat(date=T, \n                                           locale=\"de-De\")),\n              session_name=colDef(width=100),\n              link_to_text=colDef(width=600)\n            ))\n```\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=F, eval=T}\n#remove sessions for which no link is yet available\ndf_link_text <- df_link_text %>% \n  filter(!is.na(link_to_text)) %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, session_name, link_to_text, link_records)\n```\n\n## Account for multi-day sessions\n\nThere is one further thing which we have to control for: Some sessions last for several days. While we have a single observation (row) for each day, the transcript for each day covers the entire session and not only the statement from the day in question. If we do not account for this, statements of e.g. a three days spanning session would be included three times into the dataset. Below those sessions which lasted multiple days.\n\n```{r, code_folding=T, eval=T}\ndf_multi_day_sessions <- df_link_text %>% \n  group_by(link_to_text) %>% \n  arrange(date_session, .by_group = T) %>% \n  summarise(date_collapse=paste(date_session, collapse=\", \"),\n            session_name=paste(unique(session_name), collapse=\", \"),\n            date_n=n()) %>% \n  filter(date_n>1)\n```\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=F, eval=T}\ndf_multi_day_sessions %>% \n  select(session_name, date_collapse, date_n) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding = 0))\n```\n\nTo control for this, I collapse duplicate links.\n\n```{r, echo=T, colde_folding=F, eval=T}\ndf_link_text<- df_link_text %>% \n  group_by(legis_period, link_to_text, link_records) %>% \n  arrange(date_session, .by_group = T) %>% \n  summarise(date_session=paste(date_session, collapse=\", \"),\n            session_name=paste(unique(session_name), collapse=\", \"),\n            date_n=n()) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  #takes first date if session span over multiple days; later needed for sorting etc\n  mutate(date_first=str_extract(date_session, regex(\"^[^,]*\"))) %>% \n  mutate(date_first=lubridate::ymd(date_first))\n\n```\n\n# Extract text from transcripts\n\nNow, with the links to the actual texts available, we have to feed them into a function which actually retrieves the latter. The function below does this. Again, the `rvest` package is our tool of choice to extract the content of the html file.\n\nThe somewhat tricky part here is to identify the relevant css-selector enabling us to retrieve the parts we are interested in. Navigate to one sample page, open the inspect tools (F12), and select the item of interest.\n\n![](Parlamentarische-Materialien-Goo.gif)\n\nIn the screen recording above we see that the statement by MP Drozda can be selected with the css-selector `WordSection27`. Other statements have e.g. `WordSection28`, `WordSection60` etc. In other words, every statement has its own distinct selector/css class. At first glance, this looks like troubles ahead. 'Luckily' though, the `html_nodes` syntax allows us to specify something like a *regex pattern*: `[class^=WordSection]`, i.e. take only those classes which start with `WordSection`. With this approach, we are able to select all our statements even if each of their css-selector is unique (ends with a distinct number). Sweet, no?[^2]\n\n[^2]: I am grateful to user QHarr for having helped me out on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66698961/rvest-how-to-find-required-css-selector?noredirect=1#comment117928799_66698961){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nLet's define the function accordingly:\n\n```{r, eval=T, code_folding=FALSE, cache=F, cache.extra=Sys.Date()}\nfn_get_record_text <- function(link_to_text) {\n  \nlink_to_text %>% \n    read_html(., encoding = \"latin1\") %>%\n    html_nodes('[class^=WordSection]') %>%\n    html_text2() %>% \n    enframe(name = NULL,\n            value=\"text_raw\") %>% \n    mutate(text_raw=text_raw %>% str_squish %>% str_trim(., \"both\")) \n}\n\ntbl_missing_wo_id <- tibble(text_raw=NA_character_)\n```\n\n```{r, include=F, eval=F}\n#test for wrongly parsed transcripts (flag_parse_error; see below at end)\n\n#session_id 7; row_id 613;\ntest_link <- \"https://www.parlament.gv.at//PAKT/VHG/XXVI/NRSITZ/NRSITZ_00007/fnameorig_684190.html\"\n\ndf_test <- fn_get_record_text(test_link) %>% \n  mutate(row_n=row_number())\n#error is due to page break which puts two distinct statement into one html-class; => are extracted as one statement\n\n```\n\nAnd then apply it:\n\n```{r, eval=F, code_folding=FALSE, cache=T, cache.extra=Sys.Date()}\n#using the furrr package to speed things up a bit\n  df_data <- df_link_text %>% \n  mutate(text=future_map(link_to_text, \n                      possibly(fn_get_record_text,\n                               otherwise=tbl_missing_wo_id),\n                      .progress = T))\n```\n\n```{r, echo=F, eval=T, include=F}\n#  readr::write_rds(df_data, file=here::here(\"_blog_data\", \"2021_5_nr_speeches\", \"df_data.rds\"))\n```\n\n```{r, include=F, eval=T}\ndf_data <- readr::read_rds(file=here::here(\"posts\", \"2021-04-20-extracting-speeches-held-at-austrias-parliament\", \"df_data.rds\"))\n```\n\nThe first five rows of the resulting dataframe are below:\n\n```{r, echo=F, code_folding=NULL}\ndf_data %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, session_name, text, link_records, link_to_text) %>% \n  slice_head(., n=5) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding = 0),\n            columns=list(\n              link_records=colDef(\n                width = 300\n              ),\n              link_to_text=colDef(\n                width=300\n              )\n            ))\n```\n\n# Extract statements\n\nNote that the entire transcript of one session is contained in the new column/cell `text` as a nested dataframe (list column; in the table above they are displayed as \\[object Object\\]).\n\n```{r, code_folding=F}\nclass(df_data$text)\n```\n\nHence, we need to unnest this list column.\n\n```{r, eval=T, code_folding=F, cache=F, cache.extra=Sys.Date()}\ndf_data_long <- df_data %>% \n  unnest(text) \n```\n\nWhat we get is a new dataframe with one row per 'item' in the transcript. Each item is an instance of the css class `WordSection` as defined in our `rvest` request. A quick look at the result, however, reveals that these items not only include statements in which we are interested, but also headings, the table of contents, and other parts of the transcript which are irrelevant for our focus. The chunk below shows the first ten rows of one session. There's plenty of text which actually is not from a statement of a speaker.\n\n```{r, code_folding=\"Code: Sample of unwanted text elements\", echo=T}\ndf_data_long %>% \n  slice_head(., n=10) %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, session_name, text_raw) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding=0),\n            columns = list(\n              legis_period=colDef(width=100),\n              date_session=colDef(format=colFormat(date=T, locales=\"de-De\"),\n                        width = 100),\n              session_name=colDef(width=100),\n              text_raw=colDef(width=400)),\n            height=500) \n```\n\nThe challenge now is to filter the dataframe in such a way that we eventually obtain only the rows we are interested in, i.e. to distinguish between rows containing statements and rows containing other text.\n\n## Filter out rows of interest\n\nBelow the code doing the heavy lifting, including inline comments.\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=T}\n#define regex for page headers which have to be removed\nregex_page_header <- regex(\"Nationalrat, [XVI]{2,5}\\\\.GPS.*?Seite \\\\d+\")\n#define regex picking up the text of a motion which is inserted in the transcript; I also remove them; speakers don't read out the entire motion;\nregex_petition_text <- regex(\"Der Antrag hat folgenden Gesamtwortlaut:.*$\")\n\n#select only those rows which are statements/speeches\ndf_text_filtered <- df_data_long %>% \n  #remove those rows which start with \"Abstimmung\" (=vote) \n  filter(!str_detect(str_extract(text_raw, regex(\"[:alpha:]+\")), regex(\"^Abstimm\"))) %>% \n  #remove from the raw text the page header and page footer\n  mutate(text_raw=str_remove_all(text_raw, regex_page_header)) %>% \n  #remove text of motions; they are included in the transcript, but are not actually read out by the speakers\n  mutate(text_raw=str_remove_all(text_raw, regex_petition_text)) %>% \n  mutate(text_raw=str_trim(text_raw, side=c(\"both\"))) %>% \n  #remove rows which include \"Stenographisches Protokol\"; refer to headers etc\n  filter(!str_detect(text_raw, regex(\"Stenographisches Protokoll\"))) %>% \n  #remove soft hyphen; invisible signs introducing line breaks  which we do not need and otherwise distort search results\n  mutate(text_raw=str_remove_all(text_raw, regex(\"\\\\p{Cf}+\"))) %>% \n  mutate(row_id=row_number()) \n\n#extract period and session\ndf_text_filtered <- df_text_filtered %>% \n  #include legislative period again\n  mutate(legis_period=str_extract(link_to_text, regex(\"(?<=VHG\\\\/)[^\\\\/]*\")),\n         .before=date_session) %>% \n  #create a session_id for easier data management\n  mutate(session_id=str_extract(link_to_text, regex(\"(?<=NRSITZ_)\\\\d+\")) %>% \n           as.numeric(),\n         .after=legis_period) %>% \n  relocate(session_name, .after=session_id) %>% \n  arrange(legis_period, session_id) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(row_id=row_number()) \n\n```\n\nAfter this process we reduced our dataframe from `r nrow(df_data_long) %>% scales::comma()` to `r nrow(df_text_filtered) %>% scales::comma()` rows.\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=T}\nnrow(df_data_long)\n```\n\n```{r, code_folding=NULL, echo=T}\nnrow(df_text_filtered)\n```\n\n## Extract speakers\n\nIn the next step, I'll retrieve the name of the speakers from the extracted strings. As the sample output below shows, the speaker's name is always contained in the opening text section before a colon, after which the actual statement starts. I'll later call this part of the row `speaker_prep`.\n\n```{r, echo=F}\ndf_text_filtered %>% \n  select(text_raw) %>% \n  mutate(text_raw=str_trunc(text_raw, width=100)) %>% \n  slice_sample(., n=5)\n```\n\n### Compile dataset containing all members of government and parliament\n\nTo be able to extract the names of the speakers, I needed to create a dataframe containing the name of all MPs and government members for each legislative period. Subsequently, I'll check whether any of these names is present in the opening section of a statement by using the `regex_left_join` function from the `fuzzyjoin` package.\n\nThe data on MPs I retrieve from Flooh Perlot's (`@drawingdata`) pertaining github [repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ginseng666/Abgeordnete-MPs-Austria-1920-2020/master/nr_complete.json){target=\"_blank\"}; the data on members of government is extracted from a [repository](https://github.com/werkstattcodes/AT_gov_members){target=\"_blank\"} I created after scraping the data from the parliament's website.

There were only `r df_extract %>% filter(is.na(speaker)) %>% nrow()` instances in which no speaker could be identified.\n\n```{r}\ntable(is.na(df_extract$speaker))\n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\ndf_missing_names <- df_extract %>% \n  filter(is.na(speaker)) %>% \n  distinct(speaker, speaker_prep)\n```\n\nThese instances can be traced back to `r nrow(df_missing_names)` distinct cases, which overwhelmingly concern speakers who were not members of the Austrian Parliament or Government. I will revisit these cases at a later stage.\n\n```{r, echo=F}\ndf_missing_names\n```\n\n### Multi-period members\n\nThe `regex_left_join` above yielded a match whenever the name of a member of parliament or government appeared in the first section of an extracted item. However, with this approach we end up with duplicates for some observations. Some MPs have changed party affiliation, or their party's name changed during their time in parliament. Similarly, some MPs had interrupted memberships in parliament (resulting to multiple membership entries). Consequently, the dataset on office holders contains multiple rows for one and the same MP. This results in multiple matches. In fact we obtained `r nrow(df_extract) %>% scales::comma()`, instead of `r nrow(df_text_filtered) %>% scales::comma()` rows!\n\n```{r, include=F}\ndf_extract %>% \n  filter(str_detect(speaker, \"Scherak|Meinl-Reisinger\")) %>% \n  group_by(speaker)%>%\n  slice_head(., n=5) %>% \n  select(row_id, date_session, speaker, speaker_party, office_period)\n```\n\nTo control for this source of error, we keep *only those matches where the date of the statement falls into the speaker's period of office*. (A consequence of this approach is that we lose those rows where we were previously unable to identify a speaker; again, more on that later).\n\n```{r, echo=T, cache=F}\ndf_extract_2 <- df_extract %>% \n    filter(date_first %within% office_period)\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf_extract_2 %>% \n  filter(str_detect(speaker, \"Scherak|Meinl-Reisinger\")) %>% \n  group_by(speaker)%>%\n  slice_head(., n=2) %>% \n  select(row_id, date_session, speaker, speaker_party, office_period)\n```\n\n### Multi-office members\n\nAfter this step we still end up with more matches/rows (`r nrow(df_extract_2) %>% scales::comma()`) than we initially had statements (`r nrow(df_text_filtered) %>% scales::comma()`). Why is this? Well, some speakers have more than one position. e.g. the current Austrian Vice-Chancellor Kogler is not only Vice-Chancellor, he is also Minister for Arts, Culture, Public Administration and Sport (don't ask me how they put these ministries together). In other words, there are two rows for Werner Kogler as member of the government during the same period of time which will result in two matches for one single statement. To solve this, I'll collapse these duplicates into one observation with a composite position, i.e. 'Vice-Chancellor, Minister for....'.\n\n```{r, echo=T, cache=F}\ndf_extract_2 <- df_extract_2 %>% \n  group_by(row_id) %>% \n  add_count() %>% \n  relocate(n, .after=\"row_id\") %>% \n  relocate(office_period, .after=\"date_session\") %>% \n  relocate(office_position, .after=\"office_period\") %>% \n  relocate(speaker, .after=\"office_period\") %>% \n  ungroup()\n\ndf_extract_3 <- df_extract_2 %>% \n  group_by(across(.cols=c(everything(), \n                          -office_period, \n                          -office_position, \n                          -ministry,\n                          -speaker_party,\n                          -body\n                          ))) %>% \n  summarise(office_position=paste(office_position, collapse=\"/\"),\n            ministry=paste(ministry, collapse=\"/\"),\n            speaker_party=paste(speaker_party, collapse=\",\")) %>% \n  ungroup()\n```\n\n```{r, eval=F, include=F}\n#removes some duplicates where speaker had two positions on the same day; keeps only the row where the position in the name matches with the position field; row_id 11, 266 and 268\n#problem: filters out also instances like President Bures who is classified as MP in the df_office;\n\ndf_extract_3 <- df_extract_3 %>%\n  filter(str_detect(speaker_prep, str_sub(office_position, end=10)))\n\n```\n\n```{r, echo=T, cache=F, include=F}\ndf_extract_3_select <- df_extract_3 %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(row_id, legis_period, date_session, date_first, session_id, speaker, office_position, text_raw) %>% \n  mutate(text_raw_trunc=str_trunc(text_raw, width=100)) %>% \n  filter(str_detect(speaker, \"Kogler\"))\n```\n\nSo how do we fare now, did we get rid of all noise created by the `fuzzjoin`?\n\n```{r}\ndf_diff <- tibble(initial=nrow(df_text_filtered),\n       merged_position=nrow(df_extract_3),\n       diff=merged_position-initial)\ndf_diff\n```\n\nThe results is somewhat puzzling since we have now `r abs(df_diff$diff)` rows less than before. How can this be?\n\n```{r, include=F, eval=F}\ndf_dupes <- df_extract_3 %>% \n  group_by(row_id) %>% \n  summarise(row_id_freq=n()) %>% \n  group_by(row_id_freq) %>% \n  summarise(freq=n())\n\ndf_dupes\n#dupes: rows were not collapsed because of different speaker_party fields; \n#all dupes are MPs and member of govs as well;\n\ndf_dupes_cases <- df_extract_3 %>% \n  group_by(row_id) %>% \n  mutate(row_id_freq=n()) %>% \n  filter(row_id_freq==2)  %>% \n  select(legis_period, date_session, speaker, speaker_prep, office_position, row_id, row_id_freq, body)\n\n\ndf_dupes_cases\n#no dupes anylonger; dupes emerged from MPs who became members of gov; \n#columns were not taken out when grouping\n  \n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\ndf_extract %>% \n  count(is.na(speaker))\n\nextract_missing <- df_extract %>% \n  filter(is.na(speaker)) %>% \n  select(row_id, legis_period, date_session, speaker_prep)\nnrow(extract_missing) #82\n```\n\n## Adding non-MPs/non-Gov speakers\n\n```{r, echo=T, cache=F}\ndf_non_mp_gov_speakers <- df_text_filtered_speaker %>%\n    anti_join(., df_extract_3,\n              by=c(\"row_id\"))\n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\nnrow(df_non_mp_gov_speakers)\nnrow(df_text_filtered_speaker)-nrow(df_extract_3) #129 additional rows\ndf_extract_3 %>% \n  count(row_id) %>% \n  filter(n>1)\n\n```\n\nIf we contrast our results with our initially extracted dataframe of statements, I find `r nrow(df_non_mp_gov_speakers)` rows which are now missing. These missing rows are statements where we previously were unable to identify a speaker. A glimpse at the text before the first colon (`speaker_prep`) reveals that almost all of these rows concern speakers who are neither MPs nor members of the Government, but e.g. members of the European Parliament, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Court of Audit etc. who can also give statements in the chamber.\n\n```{r paged.print=TRUE}\ndf_non_mp_gov_speakers %>% \n  distinct(speaker_prep)\n```\n\nTo get the names of these speakers, I'll extract the required information via regular expressions from these missing rows, and subsequently add them to our previously obtained data set (where we were able to identify speakers).\n\n```{r, echo=T}\ndf_non_mp_gov_speakers <- df_non_mp_gov_speakers %>% \n  mutate(speaker=str_remove(speaker_prep, regex(\"\\\\:\")) %>%\n           #remove brackets\n           str_remove(., regex(\"\\\\([^\\\\)]*\\\\)\")) %>%\n           str_trim(., side=c(\"both\")) %>%\n           #remove everything after last comma\n           str_remove(., regex(\",[^,]*$\")) %>%\n           #extract last two words (assuming name only two words)\n           str_extract(., regex(\"\\\\w+\\\\s+\\\\w+$\"))) %>%\n  #these speakers originate neither from parliament nor government; hence \"other\"\n  mutate(body=\"other\") %>%\n  #but they can be affiliated to a party, e.g. MEPs\n  mutate(speaker_party=str_extract(speaker_prep, regex(\"(?<=\\\\()[^\\\\)]*(?=\\\\)\\\\:)\"))) %>%\n  mutate(speaker_party=case_when(is.na(speaker_party) ~ \"none\",\n                        TRUE ~ as.character(speaker_party))) %>% \n  #extract the position:\n  mutate(office_position=speaker_prep %>% \n           #remove name from speaker_prep; results with position plus noise\n           str_remove(., speaker) %>% \n           str_remove(., regex(\":\")) %>% \n           #remove academic titles\n           str_remove_all(., regex(\"\\\\S+\\\\.\")) %>% \n           #remove bracket terms\n           str_remove(., regex(\"\\\\(.*?\\\\)\")) %>% \n           #remove everything after comma (problem with ministers who are wrongly parsed)\n           str_remove(., \",.*$\") %>% \n           str_trim())\n\n\ndf_data <- bind_rows(df_extract_3,\n                     df_non_mp_gov_speakers)\n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\nnrow(df_data) #27995 - ok\n\n```\n\nCombining those two datasets results in a dataframe with the exact same number of statements as initially obtained from the web scraping: `r nrow(df_data)`. The noise introduced by the `fuzzyjoin` has hence been removed.\n\n```{r, include=T, code_folding=F}\n#check same number as before; all rows covered\nnrow(df_text_filtered)-nrow(df_data) #0! \n```\n\n# Revising speaker details\n\nWe have now a dataframe where each row is a distinct statement; the name of the speaker is extracted, and his/her position, party affiliation and institutional body are identified. However, a few revisions are needed.\n\nFirst, one detail which needs to be revisited is that of the speaker's position. Initially, we obtained speakers' positions by matching the opening sections in the raw statement text (`speaker_prep`) with names from the dataframe on members of parliament and government (with the latter also including information on speakers' positions). While this approach worked generally fine, there are MPs who were later elected for other positions, and hence their qualification as MP becomes misleading. This concerns e.g. the president and vice-presidents of the chamber (who are elected from the pool of MPs), or rapporteurs (*'Berichterstatter'*) and committee/working group secretaries (*'Schriftführer'*) who are MPs, but act for a specific task in a non-partisan function. Hence these changes to speakers' position have to be corrected.\n\nSecond, as indicated above, there are a few speakers who held multiple functions at the same time. In general, this is not a big issue, e.g. as explained the Vice-Chancellor can also be minister and when making a statement, there is no explicit differentiation between his two positions. However, there are a very few cases, where an individual was an MP and a member of government on the same day, e.g. Sebastian Kurz as an MP made a brief statement before becoming - later in the day - chancellor. In such a case, it would be wrong to assign such a statement both positions (since a member of gov is not a member of parliament). Hence, the speaker's details have to be corrected.\n\nWhether a speaker actually acts as (vice)president, rapporteur or MP or chancellor is indicated in the starting segment before the actual statement (`speaker_prep`, text before the first colon). If this description is not the same as in the `office_position` column, the values have to be corrected. The code chunk below does this (and a few other things).\n\n```{r, echo=T, eval=T}\ndf_position_rev <- df_data %>% \n  #corrects cases of Kurz (Chancellor and Abgeordneter on same day)\n  mutate(office_position=case_when(\n    str_detect(speaker_prep, regex(\"^Abgeor\")) ~ \"Abgeordnete/r\",\n    TRUE ~ as.character(office_position)\n  )) %>% \n  #get those MPs where position and position in speaker's identification don't match\n  filter(str_detect(office_position, \"Abge\")) %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(speaker_prep, regex(\"Abge\"))) %>% \n  distinct(speaker_prep, speaker, office_position) %>% \n  #correct the position by extracting the position as stated in speaker_prep\n  #by removing name, title etc from speaker_prep; what remains is actual position;\n  mutate(office_position_corr=speaker_prep %>% \n           #remove name of speaker\n           str_remove(., speaker) %>% \n           str_remove(., regex(\":\")) %>% \n           #remove bracket terms\n           str_remove_all(., regex(\"\\\\(.*?\\\\)\")) %>% \n           #remove titles\n           str_remove_all(., regex(\"\\\\S*\\\\.\")) %>% \n           #remove part were an editorial error in one row\n           str_remove(., regex(\"\\\\-.*?\\\\-\")) %>%\n           str_trim) %>% \n  mutate(office_position_corr=case_when(\n    office_position==\"Abgeordnete/r\" ~ str_remove(office_position_corr, regex(\",.*$\") %>% \n                                                    str_trim()),\n    TRUE ~ as.character(office_position_corr)\n  ))\n\n\n#merge result from above to original dataset; insert corrected position;\ndf_data <- df_data %>% \n  rename(office_position_orig=office_position) %>% \n  left_join(.,\n            df_position_rev %>% \n              select(speaker_prep, office_position_corr),\n            by=\"speaker_prep\") %>% \n  #correct office_position\n  mutate(office_position=case_when(\n    is.na(office_position_corr) ~ office_position_orig,\n    TRUE ~ office_position_corr)) %>% \n  #corrects for Kurz who was MP and chancellor on the same day\n  mutate(office_position=case_when(\n    str_detect(speaker_prep, regex(\"^Abgeor\")) ~ \"Abgeordnete/r\",\n    str_detect(office_position, regex(\"^Bericht\")) ~ \"Berichterstatter\",\n    TRUE ~ as.character(office_position))) %>% \n  #correct body\n  mutate(body=case_when(\n    str_detect(office_position, regex(\"minister|kanzler|staatssekr\",\n                                      ignore_case = T)) ~ \"government\",\n    str_detect(office_position, regex(\"^Abgeord|Schriftführ|^Präsident(in)?$|^Bericht\")) ~ \"parlament\",\n    TRUE ~ as.character(\"other\"))) %>% \n  #correct ministry\n  mutate(ministry=case_when(\n    #corrects for Kurz who was MP and chancellor on the same day\n    str_detect(office_position, \"^Abge\") ~ NA_character_,\n    ministry==\"NA\" ~ NA_character_,\n    TRUE ~ as.character(ministry)\n  )) %>% \n  select(-office_position_corr, -office_position_orig) %>% \n  #we have not data on gov members party affiliation;\n  #if MP than there is no NA in party affiliation which would originate from gov membership\n  mutate(speaker_party=case_when(str_detect(office_position, \"Abge\") ~\n                                   str_remove_all(speaker_party, \"NA\") %>% \n                                   str_remove(., \",\") %>% \n                                   str_trim(),\n                                 body==\"government\" ~ NA_character_,\n         TRUE ~ as.character(speaker_party)))\n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\nnrow(df_data)\n```\n\nHere some of the results:\n\n```{r, echo=F}\ndf_data %>% \n  filter(speaker_prep %in% df_position_rev$speaker_prep) %>% \n  distinct(speaker_prep, speaker, office_position) %>% \n  filter(str_detect(office_position, regex(\"Schriftführ|Berichterstatt|^Präsident(in)?\")))\n```\n\n# Pending issues and improvements\n\nBy now we're almost done. However, doing a few tests to check our results reveal that there are some statements which weren't properly extracted.\n\n```{r}\ndf_error_speaker <- df_data %>% \n  filter(is.na(speaker)) %>% \n  select(row_id)\n\ndf_data %>% \n  count(office_position, sort=T) %>% \n  arrange(n)\n\ndf_error_position <- df_data %>% \n  filter(str_detect(office_position,\n               regex(\"^Bevor ich diese Sitzung schließe|^Somit kommen wir|^Wir gelangen somit gleich zur Abstimmung über den Gesetzentwurf samt Titel und Eingang|^Besonders verstört bin ich übrigens auch, Herr\"))) %>% \n  select(row_id)\n\ndf_error <- bind_rows(df_error_speaker, df_error_speaker) %>% \n  mutate(flag_error=\"error\") %>% \n  distinct()\nnrow(df_error)\n\n#introduces dupes\ndf_data <- df_data %>% \n  left_join(.,\n            df_error)\n\nerror_share <- length(nrow(df_error))/nrow(df_data)\n\nerror_text_share <- df_data %>% \n  mutate(text_raw_length=stringi::stri_count_words(text_raw, locale=\"De-de\")) %>% \n  group_by(flag_error) %>% \n  summarise(n_text=sum(text_raw_length)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(total=sum(n_text)) %>% \n  mutate(n_text_share=n_text/total)\n\n```\n\nOverall, there are `r nrow(df_error)` out of `r nrow(df_data) %>% scales::comma()` rows where the result is obviously wrong. As far as I can tell, these errors occur when two distinct statements are lumped together into one row, i.e. into the same html_nodes/class 'WordSection' (see above). Why this is the case, I can't tell for sure, but it seems a bit like a formatting mishap on the side of the transcripts' authors.\n\nSince these errors are rather small (`r error_share %>% scales::percent(., accuracy=0.00001)` in terms of rows, or `r error_text_share %>% filter(flag_error==\"error\") %>% pull(n_text_share) %>% scales::percent(., accuracy=.0001)` in terms of all words spoken) and this post anyway is already much longer than originally intended, I'll only flag the erroneous rows with a new column (`flag_parse_error`) instead of manually correcting them.\n\n## Indicator for interrupted statemetns\n\nThe transcripts feature bracket terms (*'fortsetzend'*) to highlight statements which were interrupted by, e.g. the Chamber's president, and subsequently continued by the speaker. This information can be relevant, e.g. if one is interested in the length of statements and hence would take into consideration that one statement was split into multiple rows. With this in mind, I'll add an additional column which highlights split statements.\n\n```{r, echo=T}\ndf_data %>% \n  filter(str_detect(speaker_prep, regex(\"\\\\(fortsetzend\\\\)\"))) %>%\n  select(row_id, speaker_prep) %>% \n  slice_head(., n=5)\n\ndf_data <- df_data %>% \n  mutate(continuing=str_detect(speaker_prep, regex(\"\\\\(fortsetzend\\\\)\")))\n```\n\n# Result & Wrap-up\n\nWe now have our final result. The dataframe contains `r nrow(df_data) %>% scales::comma()` rows. The table below displays only the first 200 characters of each statement. The complete file can be downloaded as a csv-file [here](https://data.world/zoowalk/parlspeeches){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n```{r}\n#| column: page\n\ndf_data <- df_data %>% \n  mutate(session_name=str_trim(session_name)) %>% \n  #keep only statement from raw text\n  mutate(statement=str_remove(text_raw, regex(\"^.*?\\\\:\"))) %>% \n  select(row_id, \n         legis_period, \n         session_id, session_name,\n         date_session, date_first,\n         speaker, \n         # speaker_prep,\n         speaker_party,\n         office_position,\n         body,\n         ministry,\n         statement,\n         continuing,\n         link_to_text,\n         flag_error\n         )\n\ndf_data %>% \n  mutate(statement=str_trunc(statement, width=200, side=\"right\")) %>% \n  relocate(date_first, speaker, statement, .before=row_id) %>% \n  reactable(.,\n            columns=list(\n              date_session=colDef(\n                name=\"date_session\",\n                align = \"center\",\n                width = 150,\n                sticky = \"left\"\n              ),\n              speaker=colDef(\n                align=\"left\",\n                width=150,\n                sticky=\"left\"\n              ),\n              statement=colDef(\n                align=\"left\",\n                width=400,\n                sticky=\"left\",\n              ),\n              row_id=colDef(\n                align = \"center\",\n                width = 100\n              ),\n              legis_period=colDef(\n                align = \"center\",\n                width = 100\n              ),\n              session_id=colDef(\n                align = \"center\",\n                width = 100\n              ),\n              session_name=colDef(\n                show = F\n              ),\n              speaker_party=colDef(\n                name=\"party\",\n                align=\"center\",\n                width=50\n              ),\n              office_position=colDef(\n                name=\"position\",\n                align=\"center\",\n                width = 100\n              ),\n              ministry=colDef(\n                align=\"center\",\n                na=\"-\"\n              ),\n             link_to_text = colDef(\n                align=\"center\",\n                cell = function(value) {\n                  htmltools::tags$a(href = value, \n                                    target = \"_blank\", \n                                    \"link\")\n                  }),\n             continuing = colDef(\n               align=\"center\",\n               width=50\n             ),\n             flag_error=colDef(\n               align=\"center\",\n               width=50\n             )),\n            theme=nytimes(cell_padding = 0))\n```\n\n```{r, include=F}\nreadr::write_excel_csv2(df_data, \n                        file=here::here(\"posts\", \"2021-04-20-extracting-speeches-held-at-austrias-parliament\", \"df_data.csv\"))\n```\n\nAgain, this post got much longer than intended, and congrats if you ended up reading these lines. I hope the above detailed steps are helpful when it comes to extracting statements from Austrian MPs. If you have any question, feel free to [contact](https://twitter.com/zoowalk){target=\"_blank\"} me, and I'll try to help. Similarly, if you spot any error - please let me know.\n\nOverall, and as some kind of closing note - , the effort to get statements of MPs etc has been somewhat remarkable, considering that we're dealing here with the statements of public representatives. A more convenient way to obtain MPs' statements shouldn't be too much to ask for, particularly in terms of transparency and accountability. At least that's my feeling after having finished this post.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"left","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["lightbox"],"css":["../../styles.css"],"highlight-style":"github","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","author":[{"name":"Roland Schmidt","url":"https://werk.statt.codes"}],"editor":"visual","date-format":"D MMM YYYY","lightbox":{"match":"auto","desc-position":"bottom"},"theme":{"light":"litera"},"code-copy":true,"fontsize":"16px","toc-title":"Contents","toc-location":"left","fig-cap-location":"top","smooth-scroll":true,"title-block-banner":true,"license":"CC BY-NC","citation":true,"title":"How to extract speeches held at Austria's parliament","description":"The website of the Austrian parliament provides transcripts of its sessions.
